Code todos
    Mag sensor addition (replacing estimation for heading) 
        - Initialisation needs testing
        - Piping to the screen is not done (Does screen request it or does mag push it?)
        - May need to create a observer type thing like gps
        - Need to impliment the angle calc and hard iron correction
    Acc sensor switch out
        - Needs testing
        - Doesnt do anything yet
    battery read switch out
        - Loads as the INA219 which has same registers just needs testings
        - Looks like theres a config for the address might need to set that on phone?
        - for now added a case for 0x44
    Wifi remote uploading
    Touch Gesture support?
        - SAD NEED POWER FOR TOUCH DRIVER
    
    Debug screen not powering on from different library
        - Testing required possibly outside of this code base
    Add second button for scroll
        - Done just needs testing

    Change buttons to allow for seleting canned messages?
